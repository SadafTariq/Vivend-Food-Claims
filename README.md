<img src="DataCamp.png" alt="DataCamp" width="90" height="90"/>

Vivendo is a fast food chain in Brazil with over 200 outlets. As with many fast food establishments, customers make claims against the company. For example, they blame Vivendo for suspected food poisoning.

The legal team, who processes these claims, is currently split across four locations. The new head of the legal department wants to see if there are differences in the time it takes to close claims across the locations.

## Customer Question
The legal team has given a data set where each row is a claim made against the company. They would like to have answer of the following questions:

- How does the number of claims differ across locations?
- What is the distribution of time to close claims?
- How does the average time to close claims differ by location?
